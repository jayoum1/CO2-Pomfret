Use the visual reference described at the end of this prompt as the basis for a UI redesign.

Redesign the application's visual style, layout, spacing, and component expression
to match the theme and design language shown in the image.

Important constraints:
- Preserve the application's existing structure, hierarchy, and functionality—how
  the app works should remain the same
- Focus on UI and interaction design, not new features or workflows
- Any imagery, illustrations, photos, or complex visual assets in the screenshot
  may be approximated, simplified, or ignored if source assets are unavailable

The goal is to re-theme the application as closely as possible to the provided
design using realistic, buildable UI components, while maintaining usability and
clarity.
